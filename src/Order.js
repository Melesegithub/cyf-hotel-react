// Extract the <li> containing "Pizzas" from the <Restaurant /> component to a new component named Order. Also, move the declaration of the orders state and the orderOne function from the <Restaurant /> component to the new <Order /> component. Use the <Order /> component in the <ul> list of the <Restaurant /> component.

// Test: Make sure the pizza order is still rendered on the page and that clicking on the "Add" button still increments the number of orders.

import React from "react";

function Order() {
  return;
  <>// WIP - awaiting prev tasks to be done</>;
}

export default Order;
